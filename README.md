# HSE GSB Career Week (autumn 2021) #
### Telegram bot to promote Career week events among students

We implemented **gamification**. Participants could earn **coins** for their activity during webinars and for bot promotion among other students.
This allowed us to reach more than 600 students registered in our bot.

Participants could: 
- register in the bot and then in Career Week activities
- change their profile information
- get last updates on Career week webinars and offline events
- earn coins for inviting other students and for activities

The bot was built on [pytelegrambotapi](https://pypi.org/project/pyTelegramBotAPI/) using PostgreSQL database. I also used 
SQLAlchemy to operate database in Python interface. The bot and database was deployed on Heroku.
